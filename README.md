# TODO-list

- [ ] show UI warning that max players exceeded in player select
- [ ] more sidebar items in player select, e.g. "Small setup", "Medium setup", "Large setup" to randomly select players to fit in X rings.
- [ ] convert `GameLive.js` to `.tsx`
- [ ] delete unused `withRouter` and `NavBar`
